    Activity: START
  1:
    Activity: Culture negative stools spiked with CL3 pathogens
  2:
    Activity: CL3 pathogen inoculated onto CLED, incubated O2 for 24h
  3:
    Activity: Locate large volume culture negative stool and aliquot 0.5mL into a
      sterile microcentrifuge tube.
  4:
    Activity: "Select 1 \u2013 2 well isolated colonies and inoculate the stool using\
      \ a swirling motion to mix the sample"
